__ATTN: CHRISTCHURCH AND WELLINGTON STUDENTS:__ Recently implemented Microsoft Travel restrictions due to the earthquakes and aftershocks in the Upper Canterbury region means we are unable to send Microsoft staff to your location until we receive clearance from our travel advisory. We will advise you on the assessment centre as soon as we get more information.

## Common FAQs

1. What's the timing?

   In the 15-minute session, you will have 5 minute for presentation, 5 minute for demo and 5 minutes of Q&A. You should not go over 10 minutes for your demo + presentation

2. What's the dress code?

   Be comfortable, but presentable!

3. What's the minimum pass mark?

   We discourage students from doing the minimum, so we haven't specified one this year! Try your best.

4. What's the room setup?

   It is a standard OGGB Computer Lab. If you want to project, a VGA + HDMI cable is advisable. Otherwise a USB with your slides is sufficient. Please bring all necessary equipment (e.g. devices, emulators, etc). We cannot offer any assistance except helping you set the device up in the room.

5. When will I know the outcome?

   The MSP team will get together that night to go through the results and ensure we are consistent across rooms. You will know the outcome early Saturday.
