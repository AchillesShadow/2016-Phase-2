# Auckland Training Events

Auckland training is divided into three days:

## 1. Day 1

Day 1 will focus on introducing the students to MSA Phase 2, talking about the assessments and assessment scenarios. We will then dive into writing a simple Xamarin App in Visual Studio, before diving into a comprehensive solution that will prepare the students for assessments.

## 2. Day 2

We will be expanding on the solution that we worked on during the first day by adding database functionality, and various other visual components which utilise the database you have created

## 3. Day 3

The third and final day will be focussed on the advanced features that are required for the assessment
