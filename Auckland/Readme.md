# Phase 2 Training

## Background

Most individuals carry around a mobile device, the reach with which these devices have is relatively much larger than any other device. The purpose of this training is for students to familiarise themselves with mobile app development using Xamarin. Over the three days we will be diving deeper into Databases, User Experiences, API’s, Source Control, Analytical information capture, and Azure Services.

Students will build a complete Xamarin app from scratch, which will provide them with enough exposure to complete the assessments. The completed Xamarin application involves taking a photo of yourself and using the Face API provided by Microsoft’s Cognitive Services to return a mood. This mood can then be used to play a song that corresponds to your mood for instance.

## Day 1

Day 1 will focus on introducing the students to MSA Phase 2, talking about the assessments and assessment scenarios. Students will learn about the various components of Xamarin with a simple cross-platform app before diving into a comprehensive solution that will prepare them for assessments. On day one a basic structure of the application would have been created, and students would have been exposed to API’s, in preparation for the following days.

## Day 2

We will be expanding on the solution that we worked on during the first day by adding database functionality. This database will store information regarding the mood detected, the time the query was made and other relevant information which can be viewed later. Day two will focus on adding a user interface to the backend as well.

## Day 3

The third and final day will be focussed on the advanced features that are required for the assessment. These features will include analytical information gathering, offline synchronisation, and added security using Facebook authentication.
